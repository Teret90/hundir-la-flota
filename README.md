![Battleship Game Screenshot](/image/battleship_image.jpg)

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship game. It was developed as part of a bootcamp to practice fundamental programming concepts and logic.

### How to Play

1. **Setup**: 
   - Each player arranges their fleet of ships on a grid without the other player seeing.
   - Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns calling out a target grid coordinate (e.g., A5, B2).
   - The opponent responds with either "Hit!" if the coordinate matches part of a ship, or "Miss!" if it does not.
   - The game continues until one player has sunk all of the other player's ships.

3. **Winning**:
   - The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

### How to Run

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed. Then, execute the following command in your terminal:
python HLF_final.py
